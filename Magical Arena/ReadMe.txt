# Magical Arena Project

This Java project is a simple game simulation where two players engage in combat using dice rolls and mathematical calculations.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following classes:

- **Main.java:** This class contains the `main` method to execute the game.
- **GameModule.java:** This class contains the core logic of the game, including starting the game, simulating combat, and determining the winner.
- **Player.java:** This class represents a player in the game, with attributes such as name, health, strength, and attack points.
- **MathModule.java:** This class provides mathematical operations used in the game, such as rolling a dice.

## Usage

To run the game:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE or text editor.
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.

## Customization

- You can customize the attributes of the players (such as health, strength, and attack points) by modifying the constructor parameters when creating player objects in the `Main.java` file.
- Feel free to explore and modify the game logic in the `GameModule.java` file to suit your requirements.
