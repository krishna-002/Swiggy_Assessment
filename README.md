# Magical Arena Game

Magical Arena Game is a Java-based console and GUI game where players engage in battles by rolling dice and using their attack and defense points to defeat each other.

# Project Description
This repository contains two projects:

1. Simple Java Project:

      - This project is a simple implementation following the guidelines provided. It is written in Java.

2. Java Project with GUI:

     - This project is similar to the first one, but it includes a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance
understanding of the project's functionality.
The game is based on small mathematical equations, and the GUI allows for a more intuitive
understanding of how the game works in real-time.
Both projects serve their respective purposes and should be considered accordingly.

## Features

- Players can roll dice to attack their opponents.
- Each player has health, strength, and attack points that determine their effectiveness in battles.
- The game continues until one player's health reaches zero, declaring the other player as the winner.
