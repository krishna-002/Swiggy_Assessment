## Project Description

This repository contains two projects:

1. **Simple Java Project:**
    - This project is a simple implementation following the guidelines provided. It is written in Java.

2. **Java Project with GUI:**
    - This project is similar to the first one, but it includes a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance
      understanding of the project's functionality. 
      The game is based on small mathematical equations, and the GUI allows for a more intuitive 
      understanding of how the game works in real-time.

Both projects serve their respective purposes and should be considered accordingly.
